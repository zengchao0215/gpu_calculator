📐 VRAM Calculation Formulas

Accurate calculation formulas based on general-purpose LLM frameworks and the latest engineering practices:

🔬 General LLM Framework
Generated code
Total VRAM = Model Weights + Optimizer States + Gradients + Activations + Other Overhead


All calculators adhere to this framework, with the key difference being the value of P_train (Number of Trainable Parameters).

1. Inference VRAM Calculation
Generated code
Total VRAM = Quantized Model Weights + KV Cache + Activations (minimal)

Where:
- Quantized Model Weights = P_total × bytes_per_parameter × quantization_ratio
- KV Cache = batch_size × seq_len × hidden_size × num_layers × 2 × bytes_per_parameter
- Activations = ~10% of training activations (much smaller during inference)
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
2. Fine-tuning VRAM Calculation
Full Fine-tuning
Generated code
P_train = P_total (gradients are required for all parameters)
Total VRAM = Model Weights + (P_train × optimizer_factor) + (P_train × gradient_precision_bytes) + Activations
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
PEFT Methods (LoRA/QLoRA/Prefix-Tuning)
Generated code
P_train << P_total (gradients are required for only a small subset of parameters)

LoRA: P_train = calculateLoRAParams(rank), typically ~1% of total parameters
QLoRA: Base model is quantized + LoRA parameters
Prefix-Tuning: P_train ≈ 1% × P_total
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
3. Training VRAM Calculation
Generated code
P_train = P_total (Full parameter training)
Total VRAM = Model Weights + Optimizer States + Gradients + Activations + Other Overhead

Where:
- Optimizer States = P_total × 4 bytes × optimizer_factor (SGD=1, AdamW=2)
- Gradients = P_total × training_precision_bytes
- Activations: Supports Gradient Checkpointing (reduces memory by ~70%)
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
4. GRPO VRAM Calculation 🆕

Key Characteristic: Activations = k × SFT Activations, where k is the preference group size.

Generated code
GRPO Activations = k × SFT Activations
Where k = numGenerations (preference group size)

Comparison:
- SFT: Activations = 1 × base
- DPO: Activations ≈ 2 × base
- GRPO(k=4): Activations = 4 × base
- GRPO(k=8): Activations = 8 × base

Typically used with PEFT methods:
- Model Weights: INT4 quantization (8x compression)
- P_train = 1% × P_total (LoRA, etc.)
- VRAM Bottleneck: The Activations component
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
5. Multimodal VRAM Calculation 🆕

Core Concept: Total_Sequence_Length determines Activation memory.

Generated code
Total_Sequence_Length = Text Tokens + Image Patches + Audio Patches + Video Patches

Where:
- Image Sequence Length = (Resolution / patch_size)² × num_images
- Video Sequence Length = num_frames × patches_per_frame (the primary cause of sequence length explosion)
- Audio Sequence Length = duration(ms) / 80ms

Activation Memory = batch_size × Total_Sequence_Length × hidden_size × num_layers × bytes_per_parameter

Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Precision to Bytes Mapping
Precision Type	Bytes	Description
FP32	4	Single-precision floating-point
FP16/BF16	2	Half-precision floating-point
INT8	1	8-bit integer quantization (4x compression)
INT4	0.5	4-bit integer quantization (8x compression)
Quantization Ratio Mapping
Quantization Type	Compression Ratio	VRAM Savings
None	1.0	0%
INT8	0.25	75%
INT4	0.125	87.5%
